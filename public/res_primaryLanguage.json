      "description": "In 2022 I became a software developer. I/'ve always had a technical background. At 21, I joined the Navy and worked on submarines. Eventually I became the Nuclear Electrician Chief for the sub. Had some of the greatest experiences that were filled with dynamic problem solving centering around team mission and goals. In 2017 I separated from the Navy and worked for King County until deciding I needed a new challenge. So I became a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer. I/'ve enjoyed the similarities of complexness centering around the team environment so far and am excited for opportunities to learn and grow in this field.",
